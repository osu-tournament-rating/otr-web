/// o!TR Model Implementation
///
/// This file handles the core rating calculations for the o!TR system.
/// It uses a modified PlackettLuce rating model combined with a custom decay system to provide
/// accurate tournament performance ratings.
///  
/// # Rating Process
/// 1. **Match Processing**: Each match is processed chronologically
///    - Players' ratings are decayed if inactive
///    - Individual game performances are calculated
///    - Final match rating changes are computed using two methods (A and B)
///    - Ratings are updated in the tracker
///
/// 2. **Game Ratings**: Each game in a match contributes to the final rating
///    - Method A: Accounts for games played vs not played
///    - Method B: Assumes last place for missed games
///    - Final rating is a weighted combination of both methods
///
/// 3. **Decay System**: Inactive players' ratings decay over time
///    - Applied before processing new matches
///    - Applied as a final pass to ensure current ratings
